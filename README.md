# REAMDE

Hello! This is my first website. It's based on the [JS Mastery course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRrPE9aj3wI&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery).

This Sushiman site is build with NextJs 14, and for me, the main challenge for this site was focused on how I can integrate a given design into a good and interactive page.

Thank you for your visit :)
