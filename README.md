# REAMDE

Hello! This is my first website. It's based on the JS Mastery course (I'll mention the link in next release).

This Sushiman site is build with NextJs 14, and for me, the main challenge for this site was focused on how I can integrate a given design into a good and interactive page.

Thank you for your visit ðŸ˜Š
